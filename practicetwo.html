    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Listening to (or making) music increases blood flow to brain regions that generate and control emotions. It's a mood lifter on our worst days, and it can even take us back to past memories. So what's happening when we listen to music?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The limbic system, which is involved in processing emotions and controlling memory, “lights” up when our ears perceive music.</li>
      <li>The chills you feel when you hear a particularly moving piece of music may be the result of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that triggers sensations of pleasure and well-being.</li>
      <li>As your brain becomes familiar with a particular song, your body may release dopamine upon hearing just the first few notes of the song.</li> 
      <p><em>Just as Pavlov’s dogs learned to associate food with a ringing bell and eventually began drooling at the sound of a bell, even when no food was in sight - our bodies actively anticipate pleasure upon hearing familiar notes.</em></p>
      <li>Interestingly, music can affect our mood even if we can’t recognize or replicate the notes and rhythm. 
      <li>Science has documented numerous instances of people who suffered <strong>brain injuries</strong> and lost their ability to distinguish melodies but retained the ability to recognize the emotion conveyed by music.</li>
      <li>Researchers noted that these patients had sustained damage to the temporal lobes of the brain, a region involved in comprehending melody; their frontal lobes, which play a role in emotional regulation, were unaffected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What song do you remember from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuJOXv6UJ7I" target="_blank">1990's</a> era of music?</p>

    <!-- I remember Jay-Z, Smashmouth, and the Pokemon theme song off the top of my head :-) -->

    <h3>Music's Association to Memory</h3>
    <p>Music is complex; it involves pitch, timbre, rhythm, dynamics and so much more. Decoding music is quite a task for the brain, as it must “integrate the sequentially ordered sounds into a coherent musical perception,” according to an article published in the Journal of Biology.</p>
    <p>The mental processes involved in knitting individual sounds together into the overall perception of a song is quite similar to the process the brain goes through in reading, which involves first recognizing individual letters and sounds and then ultimately gleaning meaning from sentences and paragraphs.</p>
    <p>Working memory is involved in both processes, and scientists believe there’s a great deal of overlap between working memory for musical stimuli and for verbal stimuli.</p>
    <p>Emotions, of course, enhance memory. Most adults can still recall every word of the songs they loved in high school – largely because adolescence is a time of heightened emotion. (The fact that most of us played those songs over and over also helps!)</p>
    <p>Evidence suggests that listening to music may help brain cells process information more efficiently and may facilitate the brain’s ability to adapt.</p>
    <p>According to a study published in the scientific journal Brain, adults who suffered a stroke and listened to music daily experienced significantly greater gains in verbal memory and cognition after two months than stroke survivors who listened to audio books and those who didn’t listen to either music or books on a daily basis.</p>
