    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a nonstick sauté pan or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat, and add onions.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring, until the onions start to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Add kimchi and kimchi juice, and stir until it comes to a boil, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Spam or ground beef, and cook until sauce is nearly dried out, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Break up the rice in the pan with a spatula, and stir it to incorporate. </li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed the sauce and is very hot, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. Taste, and adjust with more soy sauce, sesame oil or kimchi juice. </li>
        <li>Turn heat down slightly, but let the rice continue to cook, untouched, to lightly brown while you cook the eggs.</li>
        <li>Place a small nonstick sauté pan over medium heat, and add the vegetable oil. When it is hot, add eggs, season with salt and fry to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Serve rice topped with fried eggs, nori and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
